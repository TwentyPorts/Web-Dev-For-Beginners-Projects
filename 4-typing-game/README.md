My version of the typing game.

Extra functionalities (beyond scope of lesson):

* Disable the input event listener on completion, and re-enable it when the button is clicked

* Add 2-second delay between quote being shown and player being able to type

* Disable the textbox when the player completes the quote

* Display wpm (words per minute) after finishing the quote, calculated based on character count

* Store high score based on wpm using localStorage

* Various CSS changes (incl. border around quote for emphasis)
